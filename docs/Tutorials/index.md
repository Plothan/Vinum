# Get Started

Hello there, welcome to the Vinum's tutorial section! In this section, you will be introduced to the tools that Vinum provides to let you build scalable and performant systems that require state management using Vinum.

??? Warning "Vinum is in beta stage"
    Vinum is still heavily in beta stage, which means you ***will probably*** encounter bugs, or major changes in behavior, or features being removed.

    Although don't let this stop you from ever using Vinum! Despite this, Vinum is still heavily-tested and is ready for public non-production use! Additionally, this is also the best place for you to suggest groundbreaking features without worrying about backwards compatibility.

# Needed Knowledge

These tutorails assume that:

* You are comfortable with luau otherwise you will be learning Luau and Vinum at the same time, which is incredibly unproductive!
    
* You are comfortable with Roblox Studio, otherwise, you won't be able to build upon Vinum.

Depending on your experience, some topics might be easy, or a little bit diffcult - take your time!

# How These Tutorials Work

This section will explain some important notes about how tutorials will be presented in this Doc - please don't skip anything.

* "Fundamental" - The place for the basics that you at least need to start building applications using Vinum.
* "Advanced" - The place for advanced tutorials - You don't need those to build a normal application, although they are useful for scalable application development.

The tutorials presented in both categories are arranged in an order to make it easier for you to learn concepts introduced by Vinum - you are advised to not skip any tutorial if you are a newcorner. It is perfectly fine to reread a tutorial if you want a quick refresh.
