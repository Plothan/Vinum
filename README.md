An ultra-fast multi-paradigm and modern reactive state management library while providing a scalable interface.  

## Features
* **Multi-paradigm: Self-Contained and Centralized**: In Vinum, you can have centralized state in objects known as `Groups`, or self-contained in objects such as `Hold` - all while providing consistent integration between the two.
* **Ultra Fast**: Vinum's `graph`ing system is incredibly fast, therefore, dependency management has never been faster. Additionally, all provided objects are optimized to be as fast as possible. In our benchmarks (see `benchmarks`), the performance of Vinum was ~1.5us - beating all other known state management libraries out there.
* **Balance In Strictness & Flexibility**: Every Vinum object you would use requires a function that allows you to drop updates or to allow them, and to do any middleware needed - although output alteration isn't allowed and will never be.
* **Simple, and Declarative Gate**: State management in Vinum is beautifully simple and scalable - no boilerplate code for implementing a simple feature!
* **Dependencies? Never heard of em**: You would never worry again about how managing dependencies - all of that is abstracted away!
