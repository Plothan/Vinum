An ultra-fast, multi-paradigm and modern reactive state management library intended for performance-critical systems - while also providing a simple and declarative API.

## Features

* **Centralized or Self-Contained** - Vinum doesn't "force" you into either centralized or self-contained paradigms, in fact, it allows for powerful integration between the two to leverage the best of the two worlds.
* **Ultra speed for Performance critical systems** - Vinum is insanely optimized to yield benchmark results that don't exceed 1.3us, in fact, most of the results were lower than a microsecond. Due to this incredible speed, Vinum is the best of its kind for performance critical systems.
* **Balanced Strictness & Flexibility** - In Vinum, you have to pass a processor function that allows for you to manage middleware, garbage collection, and even typechecking - although you aren't allowed to alter outcome as this decreases predictability.
* **Declarative API** - State management in Vinum is beautifully simple and scalable - no boilerplate code for implementing a simple feature!
* **Dependencies? Never heard of them** - In Vinum, you don't have to worry about dependency management and optimization, all of that is abstracted away and heavily optimized by Vinum.
