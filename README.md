## Features
* **Multi-Paradigm** - Vinum offers state centralization and self-containment, alongside powerful integration between the two.

* **Blazing Fast** - Vinum is insanely optimized to yield incredible speed. Becuase of this, Vinum is the best of its kind for performance-critical systems.

* **Strictness and Flexibility** - In Vinum, Processors allow for greater flexibility, however, they aren't allowed to modify the new value, therefore, allowing for strictness and predictability.

* **Declarative Syntax** - State management is dead simple- no need to manually manage dependencies!
