## I have a new idea to suggest
Great! We appreciate new ideas, however make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure that your idea(s) matches our standards and goals.

* **Declarative API** - Users should think in terms of end results rather than the steps the computer have to perform.
* **Speed should be a Priority but not an excuse for reduced Readability** - We love fast performing code, however we don't accept changes that directly affect the readability of Vinum codebase.
* **Features should have a global use case** - Features that feel too specifc aren't welcomed and are recommended to be distrubuted as third party libraries.
* **Should not prefer writability over readability** - Code is written once, and reviewed and understood many times, and thus, we should optimize for that instead.
