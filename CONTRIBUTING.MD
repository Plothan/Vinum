# Contributing to Vinum
Vinum welcomes contributions from the community, however make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure nobody's time is wasted.

## I have a question or need help with Vinum

Use [the Vinum's offical Discussion](https://github.com/Plothan/Vinum/discussions) and choose the correct category for your needs.

## I have a new idea to suggest
Great! We appreciate new ideas, however make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure that your idea(s) matches our standards and goals.

* **Declarative API** - Users should think in terms of end results rather than the steps the computer have to perform.
* **Speed should be a Priority but not an excuse for reduced Readability** - We love fast performing code, however we don't accept changes that directly affect the readability of Vinum codebase.
* **Features should have a global use case** - Features that feel too specifc aren't welcomed and are recommended to be distrubuted as third party libraries.
* **Should not prefer writability over readability** - Code is written once, and reviewed and understood many times, and thus, we should optimize for that instead.

## I have a bug/issue to report!

Vinum heavily welcomes bug reports, however, make sure that:

1. **You are actually the first one to report it** - Make sure that nobody has already reported it in Github's issue tracker, whether it is closed or opened although you can open a new issue about a problem if the original issue can't be reopened *(for whatever reason)*
2 **Your issue's meta information is helpful**:
    * Your title should be clear, concise, and adequately summarise the issue. Titles like 'Why is this broken?' and 'my code doesn't work' aren't helpful.
    * Include as much relevant information as possible. We can't diagnose the issue if we don't know anything about it.
    * Please include simple, clear and easy-to-follow reproduction steps. You may include a .rbxl file if you need some existing non-trivial setup.
