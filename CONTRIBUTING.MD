# Contributing to Vinum
Vinum welcomes contributions from the community, however make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure nobody's time is wasted.

## I have a question or need help with Vinum

Use [the Vinum's offical Discussion](https://github.com/Plothan/Vinum/discussions) and choose the correct category for your needs.

## I have a new idea to suggest
Great! We appreciate new ideas, however make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure that your idea(s) matches our standards and goals.

* **Declarative API** - Users should think in terms of end results rather than the steps the computer have to perform.
* **Speed should be a Priority but not an excuse for reduced Readability** - We love fast performing code, however we don't accept changes that directly affect the readability of Vinum codebase.
* **Features should have a global use case** - Features that feel too specifc aren't welcomed and are recommended to be distrubuted as third party libraries.
* **Should not prefer writability over readability** - Code is written onceI, and reviewed and understood many times, and thus, we should optimize for that instead.

If you think your feature respects, embraces, or supports the said goals, then you can suggest them, **given** that the following is met:

1. **You are actually the first one to suggest it** - Make sure checking if a similar idea to yours has been talked about in an older issue, whether it is a closed one, or an opened on. We prefer this so discussions about a topic aren't saparated across issues.

2. **Your issue's meta information is helpful**:
    * Your title should be clear, concise, and adequately summarise the issue. Titles like 'This can be helpful' and 'Feature X' aren't helpful.
    * Include as much relevant information as possible.
    * Please include simple, clear examples of how an implementation of your idea would function..

Now, if said requirements are met, then you can open an issue describing your idea.


## I have a bug/issue to report!

Vinum heavily welcomes bug reports, however, make sure that:

1. **You are actually the first one to report it** - Make sure that nobody has already reported it in Github's issue tracker, whether it is closed or opened although you can open a new issue about a problem if the original issue can't be reopened *(for whatever reason)*

2. **Your issue's meta information is helpful**:
    * Your title should be clear, concise, and adequately summarise the issue. Titles like 'Why is this broken?' and 'my code doesn't work' aren't helpful.
    * Include as much relevant information as possible. We can't diagnose the issue if we don't know anything about it.
    * Please include simple, clear and easy-to-follow reproduction steps. You may include a .rbxl file if you need some existing non-trivial setup.

If these points are met, then you are ready to open a bug report.

# I want to pull request/apply code modification
While we appreciate the community for this, Vinun is still a new, unstable technology- as such, it is codebase is still highly managed by Plothan Maintainers.
